# Voice Assistant

This project implements a voice assistant powered by a chatbot model. The voice assistant can understand user intents and provide appropriate responses. The training script trains the chatbot model based on predefined intents, and the chatbot script uses the trained model to interact with users through voice input and output.

## Prerequisites

Before running the voice assistant, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- nltk
- tensorflow
- speechrecognition
- pyttsx3

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, ensure that you have a microphone connected to your system to enable voice input.

## Training

The training script is responsible for training the chatbot model. It uses the intents defined in the `intents.json` file to generate training data. The script tokenizes the patterns, lemmatizes the words, and creates a bag of words representation. The model is then trained using the training data. The trained model is saved as `voiceassistantmodel.h5` for later use by the chatbot script.

To train the chatbot model, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

The training process may take some time depending on the complexity of the intents and the size of the training data. Once the training is completed, the script will save the trained model and display a message indicating the completion of the training process.

## Intents

The `intents.json` file contains the predefined intents and their associated patterns and responses. Each intent consists of a unique tag, a list of patterns representing user inputs, and a list of responses that the chatbot can provide for that intent. You can modify this file to define new intents or update the existing ones to suit your requirements.

Example structure of an intent in `intents.json`:
```json
{
  "tag": "greetings",
  "patterns": ["hello", "hi", "hey"],
  "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Hey, how can I assist you?"]
}
```

## Chatbot

The chatbot script interacts with the user using voice input and output. It uses the trained model to predict the user's intent based on the input. The chatbot then selects a random response from the predefined responses associated with that intent. The response is spoken by the voice assistant using text-to-speech functionality.

To start the voice assistant, run the following command:

```
python chatbot.py
```

The voice assistant will listen for voice input, process it, and provide a spoken response based on the predicted intent.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the voice assistant by modifying the `intents.json` file. Add new intents, patterns, and responses to enhance the functionality of the voice assistant. Additionally, you can explore advanced techniques such as adding context or integrating external APIs to extend the capabilities of the voice assistant.

Feel free to experiment and adapt the code according to your specific needs and requirements.
